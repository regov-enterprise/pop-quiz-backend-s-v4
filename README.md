# Welcome to this PopQuiz!
### { "Engineer": "Backend" }

### Coding Challenge

## Question 1

A community has a system that consists of a dashboard displaying residents full biography data. The data is populated through an API which fetches information from the community database. Create the API to meet the following requirements:

1. A user can select any fields combination from the user biography data
2. The selection creates a combination that fetches relatives and family data from the community database
3. Another API should populate the result a new sub dashboard
4. Only authorized residents can login the community system
5. The system should handle error properly and prevent data leak

## Question 2 

### Data structures

#### Exercise 1:

Write a binary tree program methods to traverse it in preorder, inorder, and postorder.

- Preorder traversal: visit the root, then traverse the left subtree, then traverse the right subtree.
- Inorder traversal: traverse the left subtree, then visit the root, then traverse the right subtree.
- Postorder traversal: traverse the left subtree, then traverse the right subtree, then visit the root.

#### Notes

- Use Node.js | Python
- Apply your preferred coding practice and style
- Unit test is an added advantage
- Add README
- Produce use case or class diagram for the system architecture 
- Writing design documents will attract extra points :)
