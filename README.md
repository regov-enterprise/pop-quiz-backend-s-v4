# Welcome to this PopQuiz!
### { "Engineer": "Backend" }

### Coding Challenge

#### Question 1

A small community has an existing system that displays full biography data, family relation links and neighbourhood links of its residents. The data is populated through an API that fetches information from a secured database. Only authorized systems and users can access or consume the API. Create an microservice API for this system to meet the following requirements:

1. A user is able to select any fields combination from the user biography data
2. The selection creates a combination that fetches relatives and family data from the community database
3. Another API should populate the result on a new sub dashboard
4. Only authorized residents or authorities can login the community system and view their record
5. The system should handle error properly and prevent data leakages

#### Question 2 

### Data structures

#### Exercise 1:

Write a binary tree program methods to traverse it in preorder, inorder, and postorder.

- Preorder traversal: visit the root, then traverse the left subtree, then traverse the right subtree.
- Inorder traversal: traverse the left subtree, then visit the root, then traverse the right subtree.
- Postorder traversal: traverse the left subtree, then traverse the right subtree, then visit the root.

#### Notes

- Use Node.js | Python
- Apply your preferred coding practice and style
- Unit test is an added advantage
- Add README
- Produce use case or class diagram for the system architecture 
- Writing design documents will attract extra points :)
